Linux     Q) which software you use to connect with Linux machine -> putty software
++++++      Linux is multiuser OS through private key and user name user can access the OS
            Project execution happent in the Linux machine omly
        note : whatever the app we install in linux , they are fully manages servises
               means no need to start , close , security, backup etcs ,ex : RDS

1) What is Operating System , types 
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
=> Meaditor between user and computer , to run any application OS is manditory
   Windows , Linux , Mac are the types of OS

2) Diff between Windows and Linux OS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
=> Windows is GUI based OS , less secure and Licence is paid and used for personal purpose ex : gaming , browsing
=> Linux is CLI based , high secure and free and open source  and used for business purpose ex : server running , database

3) History of Linux
  +++++++++++++++++++
=> Initially UNIX OS in market which is CLI based OS and operated by unix team
-> Linus Torvalds identify some issue in Unix OS but the coorporation not except it changes
-> Linus make Minux OS LI + NUX = LINUX  LI fron his name and NUX from MINUX
-> And Linux is open source and free in market -> any organization can make changes in linux and build its own OS they called as Linux distributor
-> EX: of linux distributor : 200+ distributor
       Ubuntu Linux
       Red Hat -linux
       Amazon linux

4) what is yum , sudo  ,apt
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++
   1) sudo : superuser do
   2) yum  : Yellowdog Updater, Modified
   3) apt  : Advanced Package Tool

5) How to java application
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   -> running java application means running .jar file
   -> java -jar banking_app.jar
   -> access the app through the ip -address =>  http://public-ip:8080/
   -> still we cannot access our app beacuse of firewall security of aws
      -> go aws login 
      -> our ec2 instance
      -> security 
      -> inbound rule  -> here only ssh (mobaxtream)can access  
                       -> edit inbount rule -> add rule -> custom
6) Port mapping and detach mode ( -p and -d)
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   -> port mapping : when 2 port numbers are there and on 1 port number we want to run another port number then port mapping 
                     ex: -p 8080:8080  ( K8S port number is 8080 and java app port is 8080)
   -> detach mode  : -d  ( when app run then terminal is running and not open for next cmd then run on detach mode , so terminal is open)


Linux cmd
---------
1) whoami          : to check user 
2) ls -l           : list directory 
   ls -lt          : list directory in reverse order
   ls ltr          : list directory ,which file create at last list 1st
3) vi Dockerfile   : to create file and edit and save  :wq (write and quite ) , :q1 ( quite without) press i to insert ,  press esc and then :wq
4) touch           : to create the empty file
5) cat Dockerfile  : to open the file
6) tac Dockerfile  : to open file and content print in reverse order
7) pwd             : to check present working directory
8) rm              : to delete file
9) rmdir           : to delete the directory  : rmdir -r Devops(folder) (r - recersive) note :if directory is not empty then this cmd not work
10) cp              : copy cmd  : cp m1.txt m2.txt
11) mv             : to rename file or directory :  mv m1.txt raju.txt
12) grep           : (global regular expression printer)
                     to find the specific character , text in the text file
                     grep 'java' m1.txt
                     grep -i 'java' m1.txt  -> ignore the case sensitive
                     grep -i 'java' *       -> where where java keyword present from all files it print
13) head           : to get top 10 lines from txt file  ex: head m1.txt
14) tail           : to get bottom 10 lines from txt file
                     how to get custom lines then
                     ------------------------------
                     head -n 13 m1.txt
Note : amazonlinux machine : userName => ec2-user | yum package manager
       ubantu machine      : userName => ubantu   | apt package manager

Note : linux tail comd is most important for the developer because : latest log messages are available on bottom of the cmd
       ex : latest error ,exception at bottom
