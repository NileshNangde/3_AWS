ec-2 service
-------------
-> EC2 instance is used to create virtual machines 


1) How to create ec2 in aws
------------------------
    
    -> Launch instance 
    -> Name -> Linux machince name
    -> create AMI =>Amazon machine Image => 
            -> Select Linux distributor  - amazonservice , ubantu etc
            -> Architecture 64 bit
            -> Instance type -> t2.micro -> gives 0.5GB RAM because free 
            -> Key pair(private key) -> for security 
               Note : one key-pair we can use for multiple EC2 instance
		          the moment when we create the key pair two key are generated
		           1) public key - store in aws ( this is lock)
		           2) private key - .pem file - to unlock the lock  
                -> create key pair if 1st time
                     -> Name =>give name
                     -> key-pair type RSA
                     -> .pem for MobaXtream
                     -> .ppk for putty
                     -> create and download
            -> Network setting 
               -> firewall security - create security group - allow SSH
                  SSH - Linux machine runs on SSH protocol
                  RDP - WIndows machine runs on RDP protocol
            -> Storage  -> default 8GB
    -> Launch Instance  - here before we can give number to how many to create VM 
    -> Instance is created with instance id
    -> 2 IP address created public and private 

2) details required to connect with MobaXteram
--------------------------------------------
       UserName -> ec2-user default
       ssh-22
       public-ip
       .pem 

3) Why not putty to connect with VM 
---------------------------------------
  -> In real time we can use putty to connect with VM but it required licence  

 4) How many types of IP's available in AWS
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  => 3 types 
     private IP  => fixed ip address , and used for one machine to another machine communication
     public IP   => change ip on  every restart of ec2 instance -> and used for content resource sharing 
     Elastic IP  => fixed ip , instate of public we used elastic ip because not change every time , but commercial
                    note we need to attch this elastic ip to ec2 instance ip , so first attch then use
